# HTML Promotional Email Replica - Headspace

## Description

A portfolio project showcasing my ability to make promotional html emails.

[desktop](./src/assets/img/email-main.png) and [mobile](./src/assets/img/email-main-mobile.png)

## Tools Used

- [Foundation for Emails](https://get.foundation/emails/docs/sass-guide.html) (email framework)
- [Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en) (getting correct colors)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (layout breakdown)
- [Litmus PutsMail](https://putsmail.com/) (testing)

## Observations

- Headspace uses ~650px as their email width. This is slightly higher than the standard 600px.
- Headspace used no alt text on their images

## Disclaimer

I don't own any of the rights from Headspace. I am using this project for educational purposes (fair use). That being said, I will take this project down if Headspace requests me to.
